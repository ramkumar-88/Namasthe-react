Episode: 05 - Let's Get Hooked
* Any thing you can do with react (library) and angular (framework) you can do the same with
html,css and js also, but libraries and frameworks are make developer experience easy.
* React makes your coding experience very fast and also do some optimizaton so your application becomes very fast.
* Folder Naming convension
    in industry every files and folders we keep it in src folder (may the source code), this is not mandatory but we 
    just follow which is industry following.
* best practise is we have to keep the seperate file for all the components instead of keep in one component.
* keep the constants in one seperate file.
* Two types of export and import
    - default export/import 
        export default Component;
        import Component from "path";
    - Named export/import
        export const component;
        import {Component} from "path";
