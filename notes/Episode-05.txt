Episode: 05 - Let's Get Hooked
* Any thing you can do with react (library) and angular (framework) you can do the same with
html,css and js also, but libraries and frameworks are make developer experience easy.
* React makes your coding experience very fast and also do some optimizaton so your application becomes very fast.
* Folder Naming convension
    in industry every files and folders we keep it in src folder (may the source code), this is not mandatory but we 
    just follow which is industry following.
* best practise is we have to keep the seperate file for all the components instead of keep in one component.
* keep the constants in one seperate file.
* Two types of export and import
    - default export/import 
        export default Component;
        import Component from "path";
    - Named export/import
        export const component;
        import {Component} from "path";
* <button onClick={()=>{console.log("test)}}></button>
    -- example of button onclick with call back function
* react is fast because it can do faster DOM manipulation, it can do efficient DOM manipulation, because it is
using virtual DOM (diff algorithm)
* what is the functional component in react - it is a normal javascript function.
what is basically a react element at the end of the day - it is a plain javascript object
similarly a react hook at the end of the day - is a normal javascript function which is given to us by react,
its a pre-build the only thing is, that function comes with some super power,
that function has some logic writtern behind the scene inside react, that function is a utility function
given by react to us.
* useState hook is used within component react.
* local state variable scope is inside the component only.
* const [listOfRestaurants] = useState([]);
    -- inside the useState we pass the empty array it is called default value assignment like below
    let listOfRestaurants = [];
    -- we can pass empty array or null or default object values in useState.
* the super powerfull variable (state) keeps ui and sync with the data layer.
* when ever a state varible updates react re-render the components.

React Algorithm
================
React uses reconciliation algorithm (React fiber) (came in React 16)
=================================================
React fiber is the new way of finding the differents and updating the DOM.
Take as example restaurant container has 7 restaurant cards and after the filter it changed to 3 restaurant
means, how the changes are happpend ?
* virtual DOM is not a actual DOM 
* virtual DOM is a representation of actual DOM
* diff algorithm find out the differents b/w updated virtual DOM and previous virtual DOM, once it find out
the differents b/w new DOM(object) and old DOM(object), then it will update the real DOM.
* find out the differents b/w two html code is tough but find out the differents b/w two object is faster,
whatever you see in the UI over here, react keeps at track of all these UI (all these html as a virtual DOM)
as a virtual DOM (what is virtual DOM - its kind of object representation of this whole DOM),
when ever we click on some thing, a new object is formed, react find out the differents b/w older and new DOm,
when it find out the differents b/w two DOM's then only it actually update the real DOM, it doesn't find out the
differents b/w html code,react doesn't touch DOM a lot, that is why react is fast, that is why every thing
is fast in react.
whenever there is a change in any state variable, react will find out the differents b/w virtual DOM and it will
re-render the component, it will update the DOM.
* why react is fast
    -- react is doing efficient DOM manipulation because it uses virtual DOM
    -- virtual DOM become popular concept when react uses this, virtual DOM is a concept existing in long back,
    virtual DOM is not a react thing, virtual DOM is kind of like a javascript representation of it (object representation)
    that is virtual DOM, react took that and build its own algorithm over that virtual DOM, react can efficently find out the
    differents b/w virtual DOM and update the UI, this is the core of react algorithm.
    -- it keeping the ui layer and data layer are sync, that is what the core algorithm of react.
