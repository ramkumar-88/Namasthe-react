Episode: 07 - Finding the path
==============================
* useEffect()
    -- if not mention the dependency array => useEffect is called on every component render.
    -- if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on only initial render.
    -- if dependency array is [btnNameReact] => called everytime btnNameReact is updated.
* useState()
    -- never use useState in outside in your component, if do it will throw an error.
    -- useState is used to create a local state variable within our component.

we use the routing in react using react-route-dom library.
* when ever we have create route, we have to create routing configuration.
* here we using react router version 6.
* import {createBrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom";
  createBrowserRouter - is for creating router configuration
* RouterProvider - is for provide the router configuration
  Outlet - this will replace the routes given in RouterProvider
import {createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet} from "react-router-dom";
const AppLayout = () => {
  return(
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  )
}
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter ([
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <AppLayout />,
        children: [
                  {
                    path: "/",
                    element: <Body />
                  },
                  {
                    path: "/about",
                    element: <About />
                  },
                  {
                    path: "/contact",
                    element: <Contact />
                  },

        ]
      },

]);
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(doument.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />); 
* rafce type this keyword to auto generate a new component based on file name in vs code.

* In react don't use the anchor tag, because my whole page got refreshed,
instead of anchor tag use the link from react-router-dom.
<a href="/about">About</a>
instead of the above use below
<link to="/about">About</link>
once we use link means it will not reload the page, only the particular component replaced,
that's why our react is called single page application, whole single component.
it just changing the component, it not reloading the component.

* There is 2 types of routing in web application.
  1.client side routing
  2.server side routing.
