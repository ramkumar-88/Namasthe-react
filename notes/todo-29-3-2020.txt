* The power of your subconscious mind.
>> Your sub conscious mind is a supra conscious mind.
    Don't call it subconsciour mind, because it knows much more that you know right now.
    What you know is very limited state of awareness, but your supra-conscious mind knows every thing.
    Here's what you do. You should ask questions like the following.
    1.Who am i?
    What do i want?
    What is my purpose?
    what do i want to contribute?
    what kind of friendships do i want to have?
    what kind of unique skills and talents do i have?
    you can even ask questions, of yourself before you sleep at night.
    then you find solutions either in the form of interesting ideas, creative solutions, or you'll meet
    people situations,circumstances, events that will be answering your questions because your supra conscious mind,
    it starts do a file search and it delivers the answers to you when you need them.

#calculations
-------------
1.note down or calculate the gold price by the slip and bill. 
91.6%(22 carat) gold price is 4510 means the 100%(24 carat) gold price is calculated as below.
(91.6/100) * 4510rs.
so the price is 4923rs - we have to calculate the price for 1% 4923/100 as 49.23rs
multiply the 1% price into what ever percentage you want.
49.23 * 76 = 3741. (note: but in appavu chettiyar kadai they put 76% as 3400 only).
>> done. 

2.Another calculation for gold.
Gold price for 1 gram = 4980rs.(on 18-12-2022)
the gold product weight = 6.830grams.
total amount = 6.830 * 4980 = 34013
34013
22% wastage =7483
34012 + 7483 = 41496
34013 
16% wastage = 5443
34013 + 5443 = 39456
GST is totally 3% for total amount of 39456
CGST - 1.5%
SGST - 1.5%


3. calculate 1 day amount if we has 24 day amount is 155rs.   
>> 155%24 = 6.46
>> 1 day amount is 6.46 and the 24 day amounnt is 155rs. 

4.Tax calculation.
For the first Rs. 2.5 lakh of your taxable income you pay zero tax.        
For the next Rs. 2.5 lakhs you pay 5% i.e. Rs 12,500.
For the next 5 lakhs you pay 20% i.e. Rs 1,00,000.
For your taxable income part which exceeds Rs. 10 lakhs you pay 30% on entire amount.

tax detuction.
>> HRA,PF,VPF,MF,Insurance, FD for 3 years.         

5.investment.
114 / 12%  = 9.5years (my money get 3 times (if we put 1L after 9.5years it will back as 3L))

72 / Rate of interest (%) = No.of years
72 / No.of Years = Rate of interest (%)

72/12% = 6 years
>> our inverstment with 12% return on every year with the 6years of time, the amount will be double.

சாதாரண மக்களுக்கு மனநல ஆரோக்கியத்தை உணவு முறை மூலம் மேம்படுத்துவது போல மனநலம் சார்ந்த நோய்கள் உள்ளவர்களும் உணவு முறை மாற்றங்கள் மூலம் சில முன்னேற்றங்கள் காண முடியும். 
மன அழுத்த நோய் உள்ளவர்கள் சர்க்கரை மற்றும் குப்பை உணவுகளிலிருந்து விலகி இருக்க வேண்டும். பழங்கள், காய்கறிகள், முழு தானியங்கள் மற்றும் ஒமேகா-3 கொழுப்பு உள்ள உணவுகளை அதிகம் சேர்த்துக்கொள்ள வேண்டும். 
நட்ஸ் வகைகளில் உள்ள மெக்னீசியம் மற்றும் ஜிங்க் சத்து, பதற்றத்திற்கு மிகவும் நல்லது. ஸ்கைசோப்ரீனியா போன்ற தீவிர மனநோய் உள்ளவர்கள், அதிக சர்க்கரை உள்ள உணவுகளையும், எண்ணெயில் பொரித்த கொழுப்பு உணவுகளையும் 
கட்டாயம் குறைத்துக்கொள்ள வேண்டும். 
ஏ.டி.ஹெச்.டி உள்ள குழந்தைகள், இரும்புச் சத்தையும் ஒமேகா-3 கொழுப்புச் சத்தையும் முக்கியமாக எடுத்துக்கொள்ள வேண்டும். சர்க்கரைச் சத்துகள், ஏ.டி.ஹெச்.டி உள்ள குழந்தைகளுக்கு துறுதுறுப்பை அதிகப்படுத்தி 
அவர்களை மேலும் மோசமாக்குகின்றன, எனவே அதை தவிர்க்க வேண்டும்.
எனவே பல்வேறு தளங்களில் உணவு முறை மாற்றங்கள் மன நல ஆரோக்கியத்தை மேம்படுத்துகின்றன. இதுவே நமது வயிற்றுக்கும் மனதிற்குமான ஆழ்ந்த உறவு..

அனைத்தையும் அறிந்த ஆதிசக்தியிடம் விடைபெறுவதற்காக கயிலை சென்று முறையிட்டனர். 
சிவபெருமானே திருமால் என்பதை சங்கனுக்கும் பதுமனுக்கும் உணர்த்த விரும்பிய ஆதிசக்தி கோமதியம்மனாக வடிவமெடுத்து சிவபெருமானை நோக்கி கடுந்தவம் இருந்தார்.

#irctc train ticket booking.
---------------------------
1.have to click the available button on after 10.59 and some seconds after then (see the seconds and start from 10.59.45 seconds) 
only we can get the book button enable.
2.if you booking by irctc mobile app, don't choose the available with number again, we can directly choose the passanger details tap.
but we have to see the green color in available section ticket count numbers. for achieve this we can select sl tap after 10.59.55 seconds only for mobile app.
3.note it down the upi payment id.
>> during the mobile app booking we have to choose the UPI (second option RazorPay for use the Google pay)
>> during the website booking we have to choose the UPI (third option Bhim/UPI)
4.don't choose the berth preference mandatory option.
5.i choosen the upi option but we can't copy paste upi id and we have to enter only.
6.we have to choose fast internet for booking tatkal ticket. (till now i booked confirmation ticket from my phone internet only, seems 
it is better compared my home wifi).
7.open the mobile app before 4 mins if you choosing the book a ticket from app means and see the seconds before 30 seconds and once near by the seconds 
means select the available button.
8.note down the UPI security PIN also(mostly coming into the standard chatered bank Gpay UPI for me).
9.open the UPI app (open google pay app) already with first credential.(check whether the app required update )
10.have to enter our name and details in carefully.
11.avoid pandian and around 9pm trains during the festival seasons.
12.ananthapuri express train has more ticket and it may possible to book confirmation but due to timing constrain i prefered pandian express only.(from chennai to madurai).
   kanyakumari express train has more ticket but due to the correct timing it may get closed earlier. (from madurai to chennai).
   Anandapuri express and pandiyan express trains has some less ticket only, but it seems we can get the ticket on this train. (from madurai to chennai).
13.if possible we can move the amount into irctc wallet. (because payment process taking 2 minutes, its better to pay by irctc wallet)
>> we have to give otp in wallet (receiving in our mobile) 
14.try premium tatkal ticket option.

irctc failure
==============
1.have to try in premium tatkal.
2.book not button not enable in exactly 11am and i refresh again so it will delay.
>> avoid this on i have to keep good internet.

4.how to build overall modifications 


My doubts
---------
1.	Ownership of WAN IP Allocation ( Sify, Customer, BSO Provider). This should be drop down box. If RSDE selects Customer/BSO Provider, then the details should be added by RSDE only. Otherwise the request should be added to CPE to add the IP details.
>> cpe ip allocation must be clarify the process. 

BSO Wireline additional fields

1.	Flexy Service ( YES/NO)

Godwin suggest questions
------------------------- 
1.what is set in javascript ?
>> 
The JavaScript Set object is used to store the elements with unique values. The values can be of any type i.e. whether primitive values or object references.
1.add()	It adds the specified values to the Set object.
2.has()	It indicates whether the Set object contains the specified value element.

EX:1
----- 
var set = new Set();  
set.add("jQuery").add("AngularJS").add("Bootstrap");  
for (let elements of set) {  
 document.writeln(elements+"<br>");  
}  
</script> 
o/p:
----
jQuery
AngularJS
Bootstrap

EX:2
-----
<script>  
var set = new Set();  
set.add("jQuery");  
set.add("AngularJS");  
set.add("Bootstrap");  
document.writeln(set.has("Bootstrap"));   
</script>  
o/p:
----
true
	

closure
rest spread
generator functions
call map apply
* sort functions in javascript 
	var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];


function myFunction() {
  // First sort the array
  fruits.sort();
  console.log(fruits);
} 

O/p:
----
Apple,Banana,Mango,Orange   

fruits.reverse();   

For numeric sorting: by compare function: 
-------------------- 
var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = points;  

function myFunction() {
  points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = points;
}
</script>


o/p:
----
1,5,10,25,40,100

promise
synchronous, asynchronous

91.6%(22 carat) gold price is 4510 means the 100%(24 carat) gold price is calculated as below.
(91.6/100) * 4510rs.
so the price is 4923rs - we have to calculate the price for 1% 4923/100 as 49.23rs
multiply the 1% price into what ever percentage you want.
49.23 * 76 = 3741. (note: but in appavu chettiyar kadai they put 76% as 3400 only).
